# Fundamentals of AI  
* AI is cloning human intelligence through computer systems.  
* It uses algorithms and data in order to perform tasks that normmaly need human intelligance. E.g. reason and problem solving.  
  **It aims to extend human capabilities and is increasingly integrated into different industries.**  

**Types of AI**
* Weak AI (narrow AI) - This type of AI can only do one specific job, like helping you with directions or suggesting movies.  
* Strong AI (generalized AI) - This AI can do many different things and learn new skills on its own, like a human.   
* Super AI (conscious AI) - This is an idea for the future. It would think, feel, and understand like a human, but it doesnâ€™t exist yet.

**Different types of intelligence**
* Human intelligence - is what we are born with. It helps us think, solve problems, and make choices.  
* Artificial intelligence - is when machines are doing tasks that usually need human thinking, like understanding data or making decisions on their own.    
* Augmented intelligence - when humans and AI work together, to enhance each other's efforts when completing tasks.  

  **Generative AI**  
 Creates new content from scartch: text, Images, music and videos.  
Does not rely on predefined rules and patterns , it uses deep learning techniques and relies on vast data sets to generate new ideas.
