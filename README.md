# Fundamentals of AI  
* AI is cloning human intelligence through computer systems.  
* It uses algorithms and data in order to perform tasks that normmaly need human intelligance. E.g. reason and problem solving.  
  **It aims to extend human capabilities and is increasingly integrated into different industries.**  

It learns in different ways:
- **Supervised Learning** – learns from labeled examples  
- **Unsupervised Learning** – finds hidden patterns in data  
- **Reinforcement Learning** – learns by trying things and getting feedback

### Types of AI
- **Weak (Narrow) AI**: Good at one task (e.g., voice assistants)
(language translators, virtual assistants, AI-powered web searches, recommendation engines, and intelligent spam filters)
- **Strong (General) AI**: Can handle many different tasks like a human  
- **Super AI (Conscious) **: A future idea—AI that is smarter than humans in every way

## 🧠 What is Generative AI?
Generative AI is a type of AI that creates new content such as:
- Text (e.g., stories, emails)
- Images (e.g., artwork, product designs)
- Music and voice
- Videos

### Large Language Models (LLMs)
These are powerful systems trained to understand and generate human-like text. Examples include:
- GPT (used in ChatGPT)
- PaLM (used in Google Gemini)

### Use Cases
**By Domain:**
- Marketing  
- Creative work  
- Product development

**By Industry:**
- Healthcare  
- Gaming  
- Fashion  
- Education and Training
