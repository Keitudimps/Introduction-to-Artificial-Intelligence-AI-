# Fundamentals of AI  
* AI is cloning human intelligence through computer systems.  
* It uses algorithms and data in order to perform tasks that normmaly need human intelligance. E.g. reason and problem solving.  
  **It aims to extend human capabilities and is increasingly integrated into different industries.**  

It learns in different ways:
- **Supervised Learning** ‚Äì learns from labeled examples  
- **Unsupervised Learning** ‚Äì finds hidden patterns in data  
- **Reinforcement Learning** ‚Äì learns by trying things and getting feedback

### Types of AI
- **Weak (Narrow) AI**: Good at one task (e.g., voice assistants)  
- **Strong (General) AI**: Can handle many different tasks like a human  
- **Super AI**: A future idea‚ÄîAI that is smarter than humans in every way

## üß† What is Generative AI?
Generative AI is a type of AI that creates new content such as:
- Text (e.g., stories, emails)
- Images (e.g., artwork, product designs)
- Music and voice
- Videos

### Large Language Models (LLMs)
These are powerful systems trained to understand and generate human-like text. Examples include:
- GPT (used in ChatGPT)
- PaLM (used in Google Gemini)
**Different types of intelligence**
* Human intelligence - is what we are born with. It helps us think, solve problems, and make choices.  
* Artificial intelligence - is when machines are doing tasks that usually need human thinking, like understanding data or making decisions on their own.    
* Augmented intelligence - when humans and AI work together, to enhance each other's efforts when completing tasks.

## üåü Benefits of AI
- Automates daily tasks using smart home devices and virtual assistants  
- Gives personalized suggestions on platforms like Netflix, YouTube, or Amazon  
- Improves security with features like face recognition and fraud detection  
- Enhances smart device functionality and user experience
